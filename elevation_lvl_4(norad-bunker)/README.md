//level 4 norad-bunker

The fourth level will take up at the beginning of the NORAD bunker. The players will have to navigate their way down the many levels of the bunker. Once they get to the lowest
level of the facility they will find the command room where nuclear launch codes are stored. After getting the codes, the path behind the players will be blocked by an
explosion revealing a hidden mineshaft. The level will end at the mineshaft entrance.
