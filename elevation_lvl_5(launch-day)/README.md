//level 5 launch-day

Level five, the final level will start at the beginning of the discovered abandon mineshaft. The players will have to navigate their way through the mineshaft until eventually
coming upon a service elevator that brings them to the surface cave exit. The players will then go through the Cheyanne woods until they come to a nuclear launch site.
The finally event will be the players holding up at the launch site until the nuke is launched blowing up Colorado Springs(death to hippies <:] ). The players will then
exit via some sort of vehicle.
