//level 2 colorado-springs

The second level will take up where the players left of in the high rise from the previous level. The players will now have to navigate their way to the top floor of the
skyscraper(an experimental testing lab). There will be a service elevator somewhere on this floor that leads down to the ground floor facility garage. Once they reach the
ground floor, they will exit the parking garage and be set lose in the city of Colorado Springs. The players will then enter the water utility building. Once in the building
the players will have to go into the basement(which is flooded). To get to the other side of the building and exit an event will have to be activated to drain the water.
The players will then fight their way through the city eventually reaching the city limits at Ca√±on park where the level ends.
